evaluate the codebase located at https://github.com/neurosaurus/Hippocampal-Anatomy-Game
research different formats of trivia games through various online sources (ex: PyGame.org)
map out trivia game (question type, question amount per category, responses to in/correct answers, scoring system, etc.)
create/agree on a basic code plan/style based on research (in items 1 and 2)
split the categories (category delegation; includes research, question/answer generation, and coding)
create dictionaries for each human anatomy category to import into the final code (VIP - seek clarification on best course of action..)
